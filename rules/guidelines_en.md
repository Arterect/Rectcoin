- To protect investor assets, we will provide information about security and make best efforts to protect privacy and confidentiality.

### Legal Compliance Compliance
- We will comply with all legal requirements and regulations related to token issuance. Where necessary, we will strictly enforce AML (Anti-Money Laundering Law) and KYC (Customer Verification) procedures to minimize the risk of fraud and abuse.
- Clearly disclose any restrictions or legal precautions regarding token issuance and trading in accordance with relevant legal regulations.
- Use the DEX platform properly and trade tokens in accordance with legal requirements and regulations; act in accordance with the rules and guidelines set forth by the DEX platform and properly protect investors' funds and privacy.

### Disclosure of Investment Risks
- We will clearly and accurately disclose to investors the risks of investing in crypto assets. We will comprehensively explain risk factors such as price volatility, market uncertainty, and liquidity constraints.
